# Perl Tutorial

Perl is one of the most feature-rich programming languages with over two decades of development. Perl is portable and cross-platform. Currently, Perl can run on over 100 platforms. Perl is good for both mission-critical large-scale projects and rapid prototyping.

If you are new to Perl, you'll find the basics of using this language in this repository. I will provide a list of scripts that will show you the basics of using perl such as :
